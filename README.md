### In this task, you will build a stock portfolio app using OOP in Java.


In this program, we have two main classes - Stock and StockPortfolio. 

The Stock class represents individual stocks with their symbol, name, and price. 

The StockPortfolio class represents the collection of stocks and allows users to add stocks to their portfolio and view the portfolio's holdings with their respective quantities, prices, and total values. 

The program demonstrates how to use objects and maps to maintain and interact with the stock portfolio.

Java Data Structures to Research:

- HashMap

- Map
